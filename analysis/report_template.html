                    <p>This report shows the monthly recording patterns for a measure
                        of primary care activity produced using OpenSAFELY Interactive.
                        This measure is made up of two clinical activities, defined by
                        the codelists below:

                    <p>
                        The measure shows the number of people each month who had both a code from
                        codelist 1 added to their health record and a code from codelist 2 added to
                        their health record in the same month or up to <strong>{{ time_value }}
                        {{ time_scale }} {{ time_event }}</strong> the start of that month. This monthly
                        measure is calculated for the period between <strong>{{ start_date }}</strong>
                        and <strong>{{ end_date }}</strong>.

                        <li>
                            With the exception of a small amount of legally restricted data, all occurrences
                            of clinical codes are available through OpenSAFELY Interactive. However, the results
                            should be interpreted with caution. Codes recorded in primary care are done so with
                            the primary purpose of supporting clinical care and so may not reflect the true scale
                            and breadth of activity. For example, codes recorded in general practice do not necessarily
                            indicate unique or new events. A patient encounter could generate multiple, similar
                            codes or a patient may have similar diagnosis codes recorded at multiple time points.
                            In addition, practices may bulk import codes from other systems; and codes may simply be
                            recorded in error. The limitations of performing research on secondary use data such as
                            that used in OpenSAFELY should be understood before drawing conclusions from the results.

                            may wish to discuss the results of this analysis with an experienced electronic health
                            records researcher or analyst who understands how clinical activity is coded in general
                            practice. Alternatively, you may wish to perform your own analysis by writing and deploying
                            code via <a href="https://www.opensafely.org">OpenSAFELY</a>, which will allow you to explore the data in more detail.

                            The results displayed in OpenSAFELY Interactive reports are automatically generated based
                            on selected codelists and study parameters. The extent to which analyses capture desired
                            activity depends entirely on the codelists selected. All the codelists used for OpenSAFELY
                            Interactive reports are available on OpenCodelists and linked to in this report; these should
                            be reviewed to understand the scope of the codelists before drawing conclusions from the

                                    note that codes may only be entered once for each patient and may not be captured in
                                    this time period. New codes do not necessarily represent new diagnoses because duplicate
                                    codes may be added in specific clinical contexts.

                                    may be recorded in way that are not fully captured by this analysis, and/or are subject
                                    to limited recording in primary care.

                                    hospital or other settings such as a private clinic.

                    <p>Practice level variation in this measure is shown below as a decile chart.
                        Deciles charts provide a way of understanding the variability in a chosen
                        measure at the level of individual practices. To calculate deciles charts, the
                        rate of the chosen measure is calculated for each practice each month.
                        For each month, the practices are then ranked by their rate. From this, the median
                        (5th decile) practice level rate is calculated as well as the rate for the 10th
                        percentile etc. The wider the gap between the deciles, the more practice level
                        variability there is. You can read more about how we use deciles here.
